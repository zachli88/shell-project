Shell Skeleton


Description

My first OS project. Involves becoming accustomed to system calls, 
the C language, project structures, and design documents. 
A few seperate tasks related to these topics, signal handling, and 
building a shell skeleton.


Installation

This project does not require many external dependencies and 
should run with this direct file structure.
